# libftprintf

This repository contains three [Codam/42](https://www.codam.nl/en/the-42-network) projects:
* libft - A self-written library of functions that replicate the behavior of various commonly used C standard library functions.
* get_next_line - A function that allows you to read a line, ending with a newline character, from a file descriptor.
* ft_printf - A rewrite of printf, replicating *most* functionality of the C standard library printf function.

Running `make` will compile a library filed called `libft.a`. Because most projects at Codam only allow students to use a few functions from the C standard library, students will use their own library in most projects.
